Pseudo finder change log
########################
v0.08 -- 02/03/2018
*Added 4 new adjustable parameters (see --help for more info):
	--distance: Maximum distance between two regions to consider joining them.
	--hitcap: Maximum number of allowed hits for BLAST.
	--contig_ends: Forces the program to include intergenic regions at contig ends.
	--intergenic_threshold: Number of BlastX hits needed to annotate an intergenic region as a pseudogene.
*Simplified code by adding a new data type standardize data parsing and improving argument handling
*Added tracker in log.txt for number of intergenic pseudogenes detected 

v0.07 -- 24/02/2018
*Implemented framework for four output types:
	[1]: Pseudogenes in GFF			<- Completed
	[2]: Protein coding genes in GFF	<- Partial functionality
	[3]: Pseudogenes in fasta		<- Not currently working
	[4]: Protein coding genes in FAA	<- Completed
*Fixed --help menu, beautified to increase readability
*Main function re-written to increase readability
*Log file contents updated
*Various bug fixes to blast file parsing
*Reduced amount of information printed to stdout

v0.06 -- 12/02/2018
* Drastically decreased runtime on full genomes
* Body of code reorganized and cleaned

v0.05 -- 03/02/2018
* Migrated to Github 
* Implemented a summary of pseudogene candidates
* Readme with installation instructions
* Several bug fixes
* Pseudogene detection from intergenic regions temporarily disabled
