# Pseudo finder
Pseudo finder is a python3 script that detects pseudogene candidates in annotated genbank files of bacterial/archaeal genomes. It was tested mostly on genbank (.gbf/.gbk) files annotated by Prokka [https://github.com/tseemann/prokka] with the --compliant flag.

## Versions and changes


## Getting Started

These instructions will (hopefully) get you the pipeline up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Installation requirements: python3, pip3 (or any other way how to install python libraries), argparse, biopython, ncbi-blast+

Databases: NCBI-NR protein database (or similar such as SwissProt) formatted for blastp/blastx searches.

Input files: Genome sequence with annotations in the genbank (.gbf/.gbk) format.


### Installing

A step by step series of commands to install all dependencies:

Installation of python3, pip3, and ncbi-blast+ on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+
```

Installation of python3 libraries on Ubuntu:

```
sudo pip3 install argparse
sudo pip3 install biopython
```
## Running pseudo finder

```
# Run with test data and 16 processors (for BlastX/BlastP searches)
python3 pseudo_finder.py --genome GENOME.GBF --output PREFIX --database NR --threads 16 
```
